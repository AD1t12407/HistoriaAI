    "history": "The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, is an iconic ancient Roman amphitheatre located in the center of Rome. It was commissioned by Emperor Vespasian of the Flavian dynasty in AD 70 and was completed in AD 80 by his son Titus. The Colosseum was a venue for various forms of entertainment, including gladiator contests, animal hunts, and mock sea battles. It could accommodate an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators. Over the centuries, the Colosseum underwent modifications and suffered damage from earthquakes and stone-robbers. Despite its degradation, it remains a symbol of Roman engineering and architectural prowess.",
