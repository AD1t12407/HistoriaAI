  "History": "In the early 12th century, construction began on the Leaning Tower of Pisa, a freestanding bell tower located in the Piazza del Duomo in Pisa, Italy. The tower's signature lean was a result of the soft ground on which it was built, causing it to tilt during the construction of the upper levels. Despite the unintended tilt, the tower was completed in 1372 and has since become a symbol of architectural audacity and Italian ingenuity. Over the centuries, various architects and engineers attempted to stabilize the lean, including interventions in the 20th century to prevent its collapse. The Leaning Tower of Pisa stands as a testament to human perseverance and the ability to turn architectural mishaps into iconic landmarks."
